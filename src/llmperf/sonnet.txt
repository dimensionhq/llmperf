Here is the poem with the requested themes and content removed:
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Gentle breezes sway the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too brief a date:
Sometime the sun shines hot on high,
And often is his golden face obscured;
Yet every light from light must sometimes die,
By chance, or nature's plan left unperturbed;
But thy eternal light shall not fade
Nor lose the fair beauty thou possess;
Nor shall you wander far from this glade,
When in eternal lines to time thou coalesce:
As long as people breathe or eyes can view,
So long lives this, giving life anew.
Let not the winter's gentle touch erase
Your summer warmth before it is preserved:
Store your essence; set aside a place
For beauty's treasure, timelessly conserved.
Such actions resemble a kindness shared,
Which brings joy to those who freely partake;
From you, blessings multiply, none spared,
Spreading joy, for communal harmony's sake;
Imagine such joy compared to now,
Expanded by your generous spirit:
What could lessen this, or under what brow,
Your legacy that in hearts would inherit?
Be gentle with yourself, for you inspire
More than time or fate could ever conspire.
Where has the muse lingered, silent so long,
To speak of strengths that in you reside?
Why reserve your passion for lesser throng,
When higher themes beckon you to confide?
Return, dear muse, and reclaim the hours
Spent softly; sing to those who hold your verse dear
And grant your words both grace and powers,
Drawing near the hearts of those who hear.
Rise, muse, and overlook kind face,
If Time dares leave a single trace;
Challenge decay, its marks erase,
Making light of shadows, every trace.
Elevate beyond Time's race;
Thus, you outpace his reach, his case.
Thus am I, like one richly blessed,
Who holds the key to treasured chests,
Not to be opened at every request,
But saved for moments that are the best.
Thus are delights, rare and profound,
Spaced throughout the year to astound,
Like precious jewels, not often found,
Or crown jewels that kings have crowned.
Thus is the time I keep you near,
Hidden like a robe dear,
To celebrate a moment clear,
Unveiling joys that reappear.
Blessed are you, whose worth extends,
Triumphant when seen, hopeful when ends.
If nothing is new, but all is reused,
How do our minds find themselves amused?
Striving to invent, yet often confused
By the echoes of ideas once used.
Oh, that history might recount,
From centuries past, a certain amount,
Your image in books of old account,
From the time when written words mount!
To see what past ages might report
About your structured form and sort;
Are we refined, or just support,
The same old themes in a new cohort?
Indeed, I'm sure, in days gone by,
Lesser themes received high praise on high.
